<p>Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. These attacks often aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information; extort money from users; or interrupt normal business processes.

Cybersecurity is also known as information technology security or electronic information security.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">üîê Importance of Cybersecurity</h2>
<p>Cybersecurity plays a critical role in protecting our personal, professional, and national interests in the digital world. As our dependence on technology increases, so does the risk of cyber threats. Here‚Äôs why cybersecurity is so important:</p> <hr>
<b><p>1. Protects Sensitive Data:</p></b>
<p>We share a lot of personal information online‚Äîlike passwords, credit card details, and personal photos. If this data is stolen, it can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and misuse of personal information</p>
<b><p>2. Prevents Financial Losses:</p></b>
Cyberattacks like ransomware can shut down businesses and demand large sums of money. Organizations may lose millions of dollars due to data breaches or system failures.</p>
<b><p>3. Supports National Security:</p></b>
<p>Government systems contain highly confidential information. A cyberattack on defense or intelligence databases can threaten national security and public safety.</p>
<b><p>4. Ensures Business Continuity:</p></b>
<p>Companies rely on digital systems for operations, communication, and data storage. Cybersecurity ensures that business activities continue without interruption, even in the face of cyber threats.</p></b>
<b><p>5. Builds Trust:</p></b>
<p>Customers trust businesses that keep their data secure. Good cybersecurity practices build customer confidence and help protect a company's repu</p>
<b><p>6. Protects From Evolving Threats:</p></b>
<p>Cyber threats are constantly evolving‚Äînew viruses, phishing scams, and hacking methods appear every day. A strong cybersecurity system helps stay one step ahead of cybercriminals</p>
<b><p>7. Legal Compliance:</p></b>
<p>Laws like GDPR, HIPAA, and Pakistan‚Äôs PECA require organizations to protect user data. Failure to comply can result in legal penalties and bans.</p>
<b><p>8. Protects Personal Devices:</p></b>
<p>ybersecurity is not only for companies‚Äîit also helps protect your mobile, laptop, and online accounts from viruses and hackers.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">"Cybersecurity is essential in today's digital world.
It protects our data, privacy, and systems from threats.
Without it, no online activity is truly safe.</blockquote>
<p>Cybersecurity is not just the job of IT professionals‚Äîit's everyone's responsibility. From securing your own devices to recognizing suspicious emails, every small step counts in building a safer digital environment. As cyber threats continue to evolve, staying informed and vigilant is the best defense.</p>
